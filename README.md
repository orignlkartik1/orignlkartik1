# Hey 👋, I'm Kartik Gupta!

### Glad to see you here!  

I’m Kartik Gupta, a passionate engineer driven to solve real-world problems through creativity, logic, and constant growth. I believe that after a power, we are creators, thinkers, and solvers — each of us with the ability to make a meaningful impact. In a world of 8 billion, what sets us apart is not whether we fall, but how we rise. My journey hasn’t been linear; I embrace a growth mindset much like a sigmoid function — slow, steady, but always moving forward.
